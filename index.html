    <p>
      I am a junior computer science major at Swarthmore College
      pursuing a career in software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love creating concise, elegant solutions to data-related problems
      (preferably in Python, though I'm working on expanding my horizons).
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time you can find me making fun web applications of
      questionable usefulness, going out for a long run or bike ride, perusing 
      programming style guides, or exploring random places on Google Maps.
