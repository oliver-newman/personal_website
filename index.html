    <p>
      I am a San Francisco-based software engineering and a graduate of
      Swarthmore College.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love creating concise, elegant solutions to complex data-related
      problems and am passionate about writing clear, well-structured code.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my spare time you can find me making fun web applications of
      questionable usefulness, going out for a long run or bike ride, perusing 
      programming style guides, or exploring random places on Google Maps.
