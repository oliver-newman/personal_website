      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I have a wide variety of interests and have always considered myself a
        generalist; I also like to have a complete understanding of everything
        I work with as opposed to blindly accepting various levels of
        abstraction, hence my desire to be competent with many different levels
        of the stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have theoretical computer science and math background, but what I lack
        in hands-on tech industry exposure and software development experience
        I make up for with a burning desire to learn new technologies, and a 
        passion for creating high-quality products to be used by millions.
      <p>
        I am a staff member of the student-run <a href="https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College Computer Society</a>,
        where I work mainly with Python, Django, and Unix maintaining a variety 
        of tech-related services for the Swarthmore College community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a distance runner on the Swarthmore cross country and track and
        field teams, and an avid road cyclist as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I enjoy doing and creating crossword puzzles, and
        studying geography (i.e., looking at maps and exploring Google Earth).
