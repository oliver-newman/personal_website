    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I have a wide variety of interests and have always considered myself a
      generalist; I also like to have a complete understanding of everything
      I work with as opposed to blindly accepting various levels of
      abstraction, hence my desire to be competent in many different levels
      of the stack.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a staff member of the student-run <a href="https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College Computer Society</a>,
      where I work mainly with Python, Django, and Unix maintaining and
      a variety of tech-related services for the Swarthmore College community.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a distance runner on the Swarthmore cross country and track and
      field teams, and an avid road cyclist as well.
    </p>

      In my spare time, I enjoy doing and creating crossword puzzles, and
      studying geography (i.e., looking at maps and exploring Google Earth).
