      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>I am working with fellow Swarthmore student Tyler Huntington
      on Thrive (formerly
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/news-events/new-class-lang-opportunity-scholars-announced-0">Harvest Circle</a>),
      a project funded by Swarthmore's 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/lang-center-civic-social-responsibility">Lang Center for Civic &amp; Social Responsibility</a>.
      The aim of Thrive is to raise money to provide free dinners to high school
      students in Chester, PA, using a "virtual charity run" system. This will
      involve a web-based platform built on Ruby on Rails, which will allow
      users to track miles and earn money for the project pledged by corporate
      sponsors.
      </p>
      <p>I also redesigned (and am currently improving) the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College Computer Society</a> 
      homepage using Jekyll; the development version can be viewed
      <a target="_blank" href="https://oliver-newman.github.io/sccs-new-home/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Also check out
      <a target="_blank" href="https://oliver-newman.github.io/bubbles/">Bubbles</a>,
      a fun but completely useless interactive toy using p5.js.
