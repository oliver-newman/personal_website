  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <h3>TeamThrive</h3>
  <p>
    TeamThrive (formerly
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/news-events/new-class-lang-opportunity-scholars-announced-0">Harvest Circle</a>)
    is a project led by fellow Swarthmore College student Tyler Huntington
    and funded by Swarthmore's
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/lang-center-civic-social-responsibility">Lang Center for Civic &amp; Social Responsibility</a>.
    The mission of TeamThrive is to raise money to provide free dinners to
    high school students in Chester, PA, using a virtual charity run
    system.  This involves a web-based platform built on Ruby on Rails and 
    using the Strava API, which will allow users to track miles and earn 
    money for the project pledged by corporate sponsors. The development
    version of the application is currently 
    <a href="https://team-thrive.herokuapp.com/">privately deployed on 
    Heroku</a>. Please contact me via email if you wish to have access to
    the application.

  <h3>Homebrew</h3>
  <p>
    I am a contributor to the 
    <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">Homebrew-Core</a> 
    open-source project, a collection of package configuration files written
    in Ruby for <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, the MacOS package 
    manager. My main contribution thus far has been fixing system calls for
    25 different packages to make them more robust.

  <h3>GPA Calculator</h3>
  <p>
    The 
    <a href="http://gpacalc.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">SCCS GPA Calculator</a>
    is a tool for Swarthmore College students, for whom no other resource
    exists with which to easily calculate their GPAs. This calculator,
    however, has a twist; for a demonstration, click the "Fill with Sample"
    button on the calculator homepage. It was built using Python's Flask
    framework and Sympy math library, as well as a bit of Javascript and
    AJAX.
  </p>

  <h3>SCCS</h3>
  <p>
    I redesigned (and am currently improving) the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College Computer Society</a> 
    homepage using Jekyll; the development version can be viewed
    <a target="_blank" href="https://oliver-newman.github.io/sccs-new-home/">here</a>.
