  <h3>GPA Calculator</h3>
  <p>
    The 
    <a href="http://gpacalc.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">SCCS GPA Calculator</a>
    is a tool for Swarthmore College students, for whom no other resource
    exists with which to easily calculate their GPAs. This calculator,
    however, has a twist; for a demonstration, click the "Fill with Sample"
    button on the calculator homepage. It was built using Python's Flask
    framework and Sympy math library, as well as a bit of Javascript and
    AJAX.
