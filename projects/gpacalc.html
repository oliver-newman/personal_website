  <h2>GPA Calculator</h2>
  <p>
    The <a target="_blank" href="http://gpacalc.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">SCCS GPA
    Calculator</a> is a tool for Swarthmore College students, for whom no other
    resource exists with which to easily calculate their GPAs. This calculator,
    however, has a twist; for a demonstration, click the "Fill with Sample"
    button on the calculator homepage. It was built using Python's Flask
    framework and Sympy math library, as well as a bit of Javascript and AJAX.
