  <h3>TeamThrive</h3>
  <p>
    TeamThrive (formerly
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/news-events/new-class-lang-opportunity-scholars-announced-0">Harvest Circle</a>)
    is a project led by fellow Swarthmore College student Tyler Huntington
    and funded by Swarthmore's
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/lang-center-civic-social-responsibility">Lang Center for Civic &amp; Social Responsibility</a>.
    The mission of TeamThrive is to raise money to provide free dinners to
    high school students in Chester, PA, using a virtual charity run
    system.  This involves a web-based platform built on Ruby on Rails and 
    using the Strava API, which will allow users to track miles and earn 
    money for the project pledged by corporate sponsors. The development
    version of the application is currently 
    <a href="https://team-thrive.herokuapp.com/">privately deployed on 
    Heroku</a>. Please contact me via email if you wish to have access to
    the application.
