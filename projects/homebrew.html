  <h3>Homebrew</h3>
  <p>
    I am a contributor to the 
    <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core">Homebrew-Core</a> 
    open-source project, a collection of package configuration files written
    in Ruby for <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>, the MacOS package 
    manager. My main contribution thus far has been fixing system calls for
    25 different packages to make them more robust.
