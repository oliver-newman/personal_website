      <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
      <p>I am a staff member of the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore College Computer Society</a>
      (SCCS). We offer a variety of free web-based services to the Swarthmore 
      College community, including web hosting, mailing lists, a campus 
      directory, and a message board for campus news, jobs, events, etc. (the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://rsd.sccs.swarthmore.edu/">Reserved Students Digest</a>).
      I work with SCCS on all parts of the stack, using primarily Python and 
      Django.
      </p>

      <p>I spent the summer of 2015 as a guest student at the 
      Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where I worked in the lab of
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whoi.edu/website/computational-biogeochemistry-group/cbgc-home">Dr. Scott Doney</a>. My work consisted primarily of using MATLAB and the Python pandas data
      analysis library to analyze a 200,000-datapoint collection of measurements
      of radioactive tritium concentrations in precipitation, in order to 
      determine the environmental effects of the nuclear weapons tests in the
      mid-20th century, which released massive amounts of tritium into the
      atmosphere.

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>I am proficient in Python, C, and C++, as well as HTML and CSS. I am 
      familiar with Javascript, and am currently learning Ruby.
      </p>
      <p>I am also proficient with include Git, Django, Bootstrap, and Jekyll.

      <h2>Teaching Experience</h2> 
      <p>I spent the summer of 2016 teaching Python and web development to 20
      minority high school boys at 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allstarcode.org/">All Star Code</a> 
      in New York City, hosted by Goldman Sachs. The curriculum assumed no prior 
      programming knowledge, and started with introductory Python before moving 
      on to web development using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, culminating in 
      final projects which the students presented to parents, All Star Code
      donors, and Goldman Sachs employees at the end of the summer.
      </p>
      <p>I spent the 2015-16 school year working part-time as a tutor for the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/">Swarthmore Computer Science Department</a>,
      helping first-year students prepare for assignments and examinations for
      the Python-based introductory computer science course.
