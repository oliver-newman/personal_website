      <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
      <p>I spent the summer of 2015 as a guest student at the 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whoi.edu/">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</a>,
      where I worked in the lab of
      <a href="http://www.whoi.edu/website/computational-biogeochemistry-group/cbgc-home">Dr. Scott Doney</a>. My work consisted primarily of using MATLAB and the Python pandas data
      analysis library to analyze a 200,000-datapoint collection of measurements
      of radioactive tritium concentrations in precipitation, in order to 
      determine the environmental effects of the nuclear weapons tests in the
      mid-20th century, which released massive amounts of tritium into the
      atmosphere.
