  <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
  <p>
    I grew up in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and attended Falmouth High
    School.
  </p>

  <p>
    I attend Swarthmore College and spent the spring 2017 semester abroad at the
    University of Edinburgh. I am a member of the Swarthmore
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swarthmoreathletics.com/roster.aspx?path=mcross">cross country</a> and
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.swarthmoreathletics.com/roster.aspx?path=mtrack">track &amp; field</a>
    teams, and have been running competitively for 7 years. I am also a serious
    road cyclist.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy doing crossword puzzles, and have written a few for the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://swarthmorephoenix.com/">Swarthmore Phoenix</a> 
    campus newspaper. I am also a geography buff, and love studying maps and
    exploring Google Maps and Street View.
